## 💡 What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a **step-by-step process** that software teams follow to **plan, build, test, and deploy** software efficiently and with minimum errors.

It ensures:

* The product meets user needs
* Work is done systematically
* Cost, time, and quality are balanced

**In short:**

> SDLC = Plan → Build → Test → Deploy → Maintain

## 🧩 7 Phases of SDLC 

Let’s understand each one with a simple flow.

---

### **1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis**

👉 **Goal:** Understand what the customer wants.

The team talks to clients, managers, and users to collect needs and expectations.
They prepare documents like **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)**.

**Example:**
Your e-commerce site team decides to **add a “Kids Section”** where users can buy clothes, toys, and accessories for children.
You gather details like:

* What categories should be added (clothes, toys, shoes)?
* What age filters (0–3, 4–8, 9–12)?
* Payment and delivery changes?
* UI layout and homepage changes?

**Output:**
✅ SRS document with clear requirements.

---

### **2. System Design**

👉 **Goal:** Convert requirements into a technical plan.

Here, **UI/UX designers, architects, and developers** design the system’s structure.

* Database schema
* API design
* Frontend layout (mockups, wireframes)
* Integration plan

**Example:**
Designers create new page layouts for the Kids section.
Backend developers design new APIs and update product tables to include “category = Kids.”
Database changes are planned for adding age-based filters.

**Output:**
✅ Design Documents, Wireframes, and Database Schema.

---

### **3. Implementation / Development**

👉 **Goal:** Start coding based on the design.

Developers write actual code in modules and integrate them.

**Example:**

* Frontend team adds “Kids” tab and pages using React.
* Backend team adds APIs for “/products/kids.”
* DevOps engineers set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically build and deploy code.

**Output:**
✅ Working features developed and committed to Git.

---

### **4. Testing**

👉 **Goal:** Find and fix bugs before users do.

The QA (Quality Assurance) team tests all features using different methods:

* **Unit testing** (testing individual code pieces)
* **Integration testing** (testing combined modules)
* **System testing** (testing entire system)
* **User acceptance testing (UAT)**

**Example:**

* Test if kids products show correctly.
* Check filters (age, price, brand).
* Verify checkout process.
* Test on mobile and desktop.

**Output:**
✅ Test report with bugs fixed before release.

---

### **5. Deployment**

👉 **Goal:** Release the software to users.

After successful testing, the product is moved to **production** using **DevOps pipelines (CI/CD)**.

**Example:**

* The new Kids section goes live on your main e-commerce website.
* DevOps team ensures smooth deployment using tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.

**Output:**
✅ Kids section live on the website.

---

### **6. Maintenance**

👉 **Goal:** Keep improving and fixing issues after release.

Post-deployment, users might report bugs or request new features.

**Example:**

* Parents ask for a “size guide” for kids' clothes.
* You fix a bug where “age filter” doesn’t load properly.
* The team adds new offers and UI improvements over time.

**Output:**
✅ Regular updates and support.

---

### **7. Evaluation / Feedback**

👉 **Goal:** Review how the product is performing.

The team tracks user engagement, performance metrics, and feedback to plan improvements.

**Example:**
You analyze:

* How many people visit the Kids section?
* Are sales increasing?
* Are there drop-offs during checkout?

**Output:**
✅ Feedback report for the next improvement cycle.

## 🧠 Real-World Flow (Company Example)

Let’s take **Flipkart** adding a “Kids Section”:

| **Team**        | **Role in SDLC**      | **Example Task**                       |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Product Manager | Requirement Gathering | Defines user needs & KPIs              |
| Designer        | System Design         | Creates UI mockups for kids section    |
| Developer       | Implementation        | Builds pages, APIs, and features       |
| QA Engineer     | Testing               | Runs functional & UI tests             |
| DevOps Engineer | Deployment            | Uses Jenkins & Docker to deploy safely |
| Support Team    | Maintenance           | Handles user complaints & improvements |

## 🔧 How DevOps Fits into SDLC

| **SDLC Phase**  | **DevOps Role**                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Development** | Automate builds using Jenkins/GitHub Actions |
| **Testing**     | Run automated test scripts                   |
| **Deployment**  | Use CI/CD to push code to servers            |
| **Monitoring**  | Use Prometheus/Grafana to track app health   |
| **Feedback**    | Use logs and monitoring to plan improvements |

DevOps ensures every SDLC step is **faster, more automated, and error-free**.
