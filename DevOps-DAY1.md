## ðŸ’¡ What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a way of working where **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** teams work **together** to build, test, and release software **faster and more reliably**.

In short:

> DevOps = Development + Operations + Collaboration + Automation

Itâ€™s not just tools â€” itâ€™s a **culture** that focuses on teamwork, automation, and continuous improvement.

---

## ðŸ’­ Why DevOps?

Before DevOps, developers and operations teams used to work separately.

* Developers wrote the code.
* Operations handled deployment and maintenance.

This caused problems like:

* Delays in releases
* Miscommunication between teams
* Bugs and downtime during deployments

**DevOps fixes this** by:

* Automating repetitive tasks (like builds, testing, deployment)
* Using continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD)
* Making collaboration smoother
* Delivering updates faster and safer

---

### **1. What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a practice that combines software development and IT operations to make software delivery faster, reliable, and more efficient.

---

### **2. Why is DevOps needed?**

It helps teams release updates quickly, fix bugs faster, and improve collaboration between developers and operations teams.

---

### **3. What are the main goals of DevOps?**

* Faster delivery of software
* Better quality
* Continuous improvement
* Automation of manual tasks

---

### **4. What are the main phases in DevOps?**

1. Plan
2. Code
3. Build
4. Test
5. Release
6. Deploy
7. Operate
8. Monitor

---

### **5. What are some popular DevOps tools?**

* **Git** â€“ for version control
* **Jenkins** â€“ for CI/CD
* **Docker** â€“ for containerization
* **Kubernetes** â€“ for container orchestration
* **Ansible / Chef / Puppet** â€“ for configuration management
* **Terraform** â€“ for infrastructure as code
* **Prometheus / Grafana** â€“ for monitoring

---

### **6. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**

CI means developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, and each change is automatically tested and built.

---

### **7. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?**

CD means automating the release process so that the software can be deployed to production at any time safely.

---

### **8. Whatâ€™s the difference between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery?**

* **Continuous Delivery:** Code is ready for production but needs manual approval.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Code is automatically deployed to production after passing tests.

---

### **9. What is version control, and why is it important?**

Version control keeps track of code changes so multiple developers can work together without losing work.
Example: **Git** is a version control system.

---

### **10. What is Git, and what are some common Git commands?**

Git helps you track changes in your code.
Common commands:

* `git init` â†’ start a repo
* `git clone` â†’ copy a repo
* `git add` â†’ add files
* `git commit` â†’ save changes
* `git push` â†’ upload to remote
* `git pull` â†’ fetch updates

---

### **11. What is Jenkins?**

Jenkins is an automation tool used to build, test, and deploy code automatically â€” itâ€™s used for CI/CD pipelines.

---

### **12. What is a pipeline in DevOps?**

A pipeline is a series of steps that code goes through â€” from writing to testing to deployment â€” automatically.

---

### **13. What is Docker?**

Docker is a tool that lets you package applications with all their dependencies in a **container**, so it runs the same everywhere.

---

### **14. What is a container?**

A container is a lightweight package that includes everything needed to run an app â€” code, runtime, libraries, etc.
Itâ€™s faster and more portable than virtual machines.

---

### **15. What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes (K8s) is used to manage and scale Docker containers automatically across many servers.

---

### **16. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**

IaC means managing servers and infrastructure through code instead of manual setup.
Tools like **Terraform** and **Ansible** are used for this.

---

### **17. What is monitoring in DevOps?**

Monitoring means keeping track of system performance, errors, and uptime to make sure everything runs smoothly.
Tools: **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK Stack**

---

### **18. What is the difference between Agile and DevOps?**

* **Agile** focuses on software development speed and flexibility.
* **DevOps** focuses on both development **and** deployment speed with automation.
  They complement each other.

---

### **19. What is a rollback?**

A rollback means going back to the previous stable version when the latest deployment fails.

---

### **20. What are some soft skills important for DevOps engineers?**

* Communication
* Collaboration
* Problem-solving
* Continuous learning
* Adaptability
